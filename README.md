# DatoCMS translations

We are welcoming community contributions for the translations of the CMS.

If you are interested in contributing a translation, please get in touch with us at https://www.datocms.com/support/ so that we can coordinate the work together.

We'll publicly track the updates using Github issues here, but the bulk of the job is going to be done in [Loco](https://localise.biz/) for which you'll need an invite from us.

If you find small typos you are free to contribute PRs but for bigger tasks please check the issues or get in touch with us before!

## Credit for translations!

We are offering generous credits for translating the interface. If you are interested in submitting a new translation, completing an existing one, or proof-reading what we already have please check the issues or get in touch via the support form: https://www.datocms.com/support/

Thank you very much!!!
